# Lecture 3 - Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
##### Reference: Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)
The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.
After watching the video...
##	•	What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
Not technical but only visual, I loved the ones comparing the most favorite words and the words by putting them in order.
##	•	What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
Really funny talk, everything well explained and visually presented. In my opinion it was really interesting, however, too simple for all the work tha must be behind.
##	•	Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
Yes, he found a topic that interested the audience, speech on TED Talks for people who attend TED Talks, of course. It keeped me interested too as I enjoy TED Talks, statistics and insightful talks like this.
##	•	Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?
I’d love to know how he did it or with which criteria he selected the phrases for the pad, specific numbers,… but I know this is not what attracts the main public.
